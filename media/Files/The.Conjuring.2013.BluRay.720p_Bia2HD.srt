6

Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,769
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

15

...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

16

245

It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

551
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,889

of demonic activity:

552
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,281
Infestation, oppression and possession.

553
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,805
Now, infestation:

554
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,931
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

555
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,761
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

556
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,207
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

557
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,249
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

558
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,290
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

559
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,887
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

560
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,291

to the third and final stage: possession.

Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

655
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,846
An exorcism.

656
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,885
What, exorcism?

657
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,810

that you do to people.

Lorraine saw something, which...

662
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,246
Go ahead, hon.

663
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,048
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

664
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,725
...and your land.

665
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,767
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

666
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,127
It was latched to your back.

667
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,690
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.

668
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,887
And it doesn't matter where you go...

669
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,209
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

670
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,885
...and it's feeding off you.

671
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,088
Even if we leave?

672
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,925
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

673
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,369

<font color="#808080">ED:</font> I wish it were that easy.

678
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,645
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

679
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,570
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

680
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,241
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

681
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,643
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

682
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,330
...and that's the hard part.

683
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,209
Have your children been baptized?

684
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,684
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

685
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,527
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

686
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,806
Why?

687
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,325
Because we're a threat.

688

And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

689

So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

690
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,210

do some homework on the property...

It's November 1st, 1971.

708

experiencing supernatural occurrences.

709
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,565

710

From the first occurrence.

711
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,486
Nothing.

712
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,241
The whole time.

713
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,966
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

714
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,570
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

715
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,763
That's the original farmhouse.

716
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,003
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

717
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,766
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

718
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,203
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

719
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,561
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

720
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,603
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

721
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,650
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

722
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,649
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

723
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,730
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

724
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,962
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

725
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,282
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

726
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,331
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

727
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,767
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

728
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,884
Well, that explains a few things.

729
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,769
Yeah, so does this.

730
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,081
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

731
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,329
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

732
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,289
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

733
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,367
And that's not all.

734
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,721
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

735
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,891
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

736
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,170
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.
